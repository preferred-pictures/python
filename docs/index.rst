PreferredPictures Python Client
===============================

This Python module allows easy use of the PreferredPictures API.

`PreferredPictures'`_ goal is to choose the best option from many different choices.
You can use it to decide between different images of the same product to show to
a customer. For example, you're showing a jacket that comes in multiple colors.
You have one photo of the coat in red, one in blue, and one in dark gray, but you
can only show one of them. PreferredPictures' choice is the one option that it
believes is most likely to result in a click or other action that you want to track.
